# Gulp boilerplate for web designers

**Gulp boilerplate for web designers** provides directory and file structure to aid web-designers kickstart their next project. It will help you develop and deploy any html-based (and more) templates. Some out of the box features :

- OOCSS and [SMACSS (Scalable and Modular Architecture for CSS) ](http://smacss.com/) ready infrastructure
- Compile Sass files
- Autoprefix styles (you only need to write the web-standard version)
- [Compass](http://compass-style.org/) support
- Compiles and lints Coffee scripts files
- JsLinter
- CSS and JS minification
- Compiles Jade
- Image optimization
- Live-reload (Only works with the appropriate live-reload browser plugin. If you use Chrome you can use the [livereload chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/livereload/jnihajbhpnppcggbcgedagnkighmdlei). For other browsers have a look at [livereload browser extensions](http://feedback.livereload.com/knowledgebase/articles/86242-how-do-i-install-and-use-the-browser-extensions-)).

## Installation

Follow the [Getting Started with Gulp](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp/blob/master/docs/getting-started.md#getting-started) for an in-depth look at setting up Grunt, but basically:

1. Boot up terminal
2. Make sure to have **[Node.js](http://nodejs.org/download/)** installed
3. Install **gulp globally** `npm install -g gulp`
4. `cd` to your project folder
5. Git clone (`git@github.com:tsevdos/Gulp-boilerplate-for-web-designers.git`) or download the zip from [https://github.com/tsevdos/Gulp-boilerplate-for-web-designers](https://github.com/tsevdos/Gulp-boilerplate-for-web-designers)
7. Install Gulp and required grunt tasks `npm install`
8. Run `gulp serve` and enjoy

## File structure

Your **development environment** is in the **app directory** - you do all the work there. Whenever you are ready you can **build** the work by running the `gulp` task (the `default` task). This task will generate a **public directory** that will contain all your files (CSS, JS, HTML and images) optimized and ready to distribute/upload/share.

## Tasks

You can run the below tasks.

1. `gulp` (default task) : Creates a `public` directory with all the optimized files (read **File structure** section for more details).
2. `gulp serve` : Probably the most usable task. Just run this task and work elegantly with live-reload and all the cool features listed above.
3. `gulp styles` : This task compiles all the Sass files and autoprefixes. After that it saves the generated CSS files expanded into the `development` directory and the minified version into the public directory.
4. `gulp coffee` : This task lints and compiles your coffee script files (you must include them into the `js` directory).
5. `gulp lintscripts` : This task lints all javascripts files except from those located under the `vendor` directory.
6. `gulp scripts` : This task will concatanate all scripts into one using the order you'll specify. The `public` version of this file will also be minified.
7. `gulp images` : This task will optimize all images (with `jpg`, `png` and `gif` extension) under the `img` folder.
8. `gulp jade` : This task will compile your jade templates.
9. `gulp markup` : This task will pretify your html files.
10. `gulp clean` : This support task cleans (deletes all the contents of) the `public` directory in order to prepare it for the `build` (default task).

## TODO:

- Add [Burbon](http://bourbon.io/) support
- Auto load tasks using gulp-load-plugins
